## Key Features

* Each philosopher is a thread
* There is one fork between each pair of philosophers. Therefore, if there are several philosophers, each philosopher has a fork on their left side and a fork on their right side. If there is only one philosopher, there should be only one fork on the table
* To prevent philosophers from duplicating forks, the forks state is protected with a mutex
