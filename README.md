## Overview

The 42 common core develops the minimum set of skills, both technical and human. It enables you to learn C programming, develop simple software using classic algorithms, and discover file system access and UNIX process management. A simple first approach to network architecture and system administration is also included. Object-oriented programming is also on the program, as is a client-server project

## Projects

- [x] Libft: Recode a number of functions from the standard C library, as well as other utility functions
- [x] get_next_line: Code a function that store, in the parameter “line”, a line that has been read from the given file descriptor
- [x] ft_printf: Recode printf
- [x] ft_server: Set up a web server
